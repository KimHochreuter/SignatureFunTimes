# github-practice
A repository to practice synchronizing with GitHub, and probably also to practice creating and solving merge conflicts.

In this repository, you find a file `story.md`. It is meant for collaborative story writing.
The story may be declared finished, if it contains at least the words "leverpostej" "alien" and "wonderful" .

If you want to participate, set up a new R project on your computer by cloning the repository. Write some lines in Story.md, and commit with a meaningful message summarizing your change (not just "added some lines"). You can also make changes to the lines that are there and add a title.

Feel free to add further stories :-).
