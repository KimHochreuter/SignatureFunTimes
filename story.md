# A story about life

Desperate to catch a few rays of late summer sun, I wandered aimlessly on Aarhus University's campus park last Friday afternoon. A sudden noise rouse me from my peaceful contemplation - I spun around and saw 4 ducks flying in perfect circles above a carp in the lake; almost as if some external force was leading them. Suddenly I could hear the carp saying with a deep, watery voice: 

"My dearest ducks, you among all earthly beings are my most loyal subjects. I am about to entrust you with my most precious belonging: the Carpstone."

Visibly excited by those words, the four ducks started orbiting considerably faster, creating a whirlpool around the carp. I could not believe what my eyes were witnessing.

The carp continued:

“But before I entrust you with this invaluable treasure, you have to swear a solemn oath never to reveal the existence of the Carpstone to the golden shrimp, the most evil of all living creatures!”

Under the watchful eye of the ducks, I saw how the carp listed more than a thousand reasons why the shrimp had earned such a label. As the last word ended, the carp was submerged to return with the little iridescent icosahedron, the Carpstone. My mind was absorbed by its beauty.
